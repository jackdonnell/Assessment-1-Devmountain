// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisofRequirements = "Here we look over what needs to be included in our code."

const design = "With design we whiteboard out ideas for the code and choose between methods of achieving the same goals. This is also the first step where we consider control flow."

const implimentation = "the actual coding part where you create the original code to follow your planning, requirements, and design."

const testingAndIntegration = "During this step you find out if your code runs and achieves the goals you were planning."

const maintain = "This part of the process happens after the code has been deployed and is working properly. Maintainance would include software updates, and fixes if the code breaks."
